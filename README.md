# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis

### Overview
The purpose of this project was to update exisiting employee files from CSV format to SQL database. This allows the user greater access and flexibility while navigating the abundance of employee information. This upgrade was especially neccessary at this time to research the effect of the upcoming retirement eligibility of a large segment of the employee population.  This data also allows the user to identify and explore the feasibility of a proposed mentorship program.  

### Results
- Over 50,000 Senior Enigneers and Senior Staff will soon be eligible for retirement.
- Another 22,000 total employees will also soon be eligible.
- Only approximately 1,550 employees eligible for proposed mentorship program.
